// code-splitting (it pins a pre-release @tanstack/react-start), this
// server-only file can end up pulled into the client bundle too. If we
// read process.env.DATABASE_URL and throw at import time, the browser
// hits that throw before React ever attaches the login form's submit
// handler, so the form silently falls back to a native GET reload.
// Connecting lazily means importing this module never executes anything;
// the real connection only happens the first time a server function
// actually queries the db, which is exactly when this code should run.
